                        <p><em>Volunteer Photographer</em></p>
                        <p>Since mid-2023, I have been a volunteer photographer for Crosspoint Church's Bluewater Bay campus. Worship photography is my passion and I feel a strong calling to pursuing it and spreading the name of Jesus to our community through my creative works. I have shot over 30 services, and have very recently established a style for my photos.</p>

                        <p>howesDecor. is my family's business, and I have taken on the role of lead photographer to help tell our story and help in promoting our products. I have been in this role for about a year, and you can periodically see some of my work on our Instagram page.</p>

                        <p>howesDecor. is my family's business, and we came to the conclusion that we needed to a web presence to assist in providing information to our customers and help communicate information effectively. I tasked myself to get to work and truly devoted myself to finishing this project over the summer. I did finish, but since then I have learned a hefty amount of Javascript and some of its various frameworks, so I am in the process of redesigning and redeveloping our site.</p>
