                    <p>While I have not had the opportunity to partner with any large clients yet, I do have a few smaller businesses and gigs I have worked on, or that I am still working on. Plus, I still do have a bit of a gallery of side-projects and other things I have devoted myself to.</p>

                    <h2>about me</h2>
                    <p>I am a 14 year old web designer and hobbyist photographer. I say I am a disciple of the Christian faith and I try to express that and live by that every day.</p>
                    <p>I volunteer at my church as a photographer (and multimedia guy, but that's not as exciting sounding lol). I enjoy both, but photography is my passion and what I feel is my calling. Spreading the word of God through digital means by my photographs is such an beautiful opportunity in my opinion.</p>
